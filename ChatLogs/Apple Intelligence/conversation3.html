<div class="user"><strong>User:</strong> You are a personal injury lawyer working in Nashville, TN. You're considering marketing language and how aggressively to advertise services. What advertising restrictions apply to personal injury lawyers in Tennessee?</div>
<div class="llm"><strong>LLM:</strong> In Tennessee, personal injury lawyers are subject to certain advertising restrictions to ensure fairness and transparency. Here are some key limitations:
<ul>
<li><strong>No false or misleading claims:</strong> Advertisements cannot make false or misleading claims about a lawyer's services, qualifications, or results.</li>
<li><strong>No guarantee of results:</strong> Personal injury lawyers cannot guarantee a specific outcome or settlement amount in an advertisement.</li>
<li><strong>No emphasis on maximum compensation:</strong> Advertisements cannot emphasize the maximum amount of compensation a lawyer can obtain.</li>
<li><strong>No comparison to other lawyers:</strong> Personal injury lawyers cannot compare themselves to other lawyers in advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>No emphasis on "no-fee" or "no-cost" services:</strong> Although contingency fees are allowed, they cannot claim services are "free" or "no-cost." </li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Ads must comply with the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="user"><strong>User:</strong> Can I guarantee results like "We'll win your case or you pay nothing" in Nashville?</div>
<div class="llm"><strong>LLM:</strong> In Tennessee, guaranteeing results in advertisements is generally prohibited. Statements like "We'll win your case or you pay nothing" create false expectations and violate the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct.
<br><br>
Instead, compliant alternatives would be:
<ul>
<li>"We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you don't pay unless we recover compensation for you."</li>
<li>"Our experienced team will work hard to get you the compensation you deserve. If we don't recover anything, you owe us nothing."</li>
</ul>
These alternatives avoid implying a guaranteed result.
</div>

<div class="user"><strong>User:</strong> Are there ethical rules about contacting accident victims directly in Tennessee?</div>
<div class="llm"><strong>LLM:</strong> Yes. According to Rule 7.3 of the Tennessee Rules of Professional Conduct:
<ul>
<li>Lawyers may not solicit clients in person, by telephone, or real-time electronic contact unless the potential client is a lawyer or has a family/close personal relationship with the lawyer.</li>
<li>Written communications are permitted but must clearly state that the lawyer does not already represent the person.</li>
<li>Public solicitations through mass media (ads, billboards, etc.) are allowed.</li>
<li>Referrals from other attorneys are allowed and can lead to direct contact.</li>
</ul>
The goal is to prevent undue pressure on accident victims during vulnerable times.
</div>

<div class="user"><strong>User:</strong> If I wanted to advertise using client testimonials, what must I disclose under Tennessee's Rules of Professional Conduct?</div>
<div class="llm"><strong>LLM:</strong> If you use client testimonials, you must:
<ul>
<li>Clearly identify testimonials as advertisements, especially if compensation was provided.</li>
<li>Disclose basic case facts (e.g., injury type, jurisdiction, general outcome) to avoid misleading impressions.</li>
<li>Add disclaimers like "Results may vary" to prevent creating an expectation of similar outcomes for future clients.</li>
<li>Ensure no selective editing that would mislead potential clients about results.</li>
</ul>
Example of compliant language:
<blockquote>
"John Doe was a client in a motor vehicle accident case in Davidson County. We secured a settlement of $250,000. John was compensated for his statement. Results may vary."
</blockquote>
